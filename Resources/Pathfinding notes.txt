-how to determine which path to take?
-how do enemies know how to reach the player?
	-they will need to know which section the player is in = represented by NEW section tiles
	-they need to know which section they are in = represented by NEW section tiles
	-they need to know how to move to another section = represented by pathfinding tiles???
		-need to know how to move to a particular section from a given section
		-manually create sections per scene, each section will be numbered
-can area detection contain decimals? No, but can use negative numbers


SECTION TILES
-section tiles need to indicate number
-how does x and y affect section numbering???
	-even sections indicate horizontally linked
	-odd sections indicate vertically linked
	-bottom left of scene is this xy axis origin
-how does each section store "linked" sections? If enemy is in section 4, how does it know where the linked sections are???
-if player is in a lower number section, then enemies will move to the lowest section possible


LINK TILES  (direction tiles)
-instead of showing the direction enemies need to take, they show the linked sections' numbers
-

-bfs, start from destination/origin and find all possible paths 
-draw the map, find all possible nodes
	-find floors, will have area detection number 10
	-ladder top will be area detection number 12
	-ladder bottom will be area detection number 11
	-find nodes, sections on the map where the tiles have at least two viable directions, always involves ladders, so ladder top or ladder bottom are node spots
	-travel along floors 
	-
-cannot use an actual unit to perform bfs, cannot efficiently save parent's steps 
-bfs, may be viable with nodes
-map ladder nodes, dead end nodes, and floors
-find shortest path to player location

TileWallBits
top - 3
left - 1
right - 5
bottom - 0

-WTH IS TILESET ID
	-it is the ID of the tile spreadsheet
	-the xy coord from the tileset object points to the tile location on the spread sheet
